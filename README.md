# Round proccesing rules

## 1. In case of error, processing should stop and no further processing should be done, clearly stating where the processing stopped and what the problem was (With a human explanation, not some creepy algorithmic expression)

## 2. Only teams known from teams file should be processed (even though other results may be in there)
### Unclear for what was meant

## 3. During the first 22 rounds, you can only play against the same team in one home and one away match. After 22 rounds, the same applies again, but this time for teams inside each fraction
    
## 4. In Denmark you are not allowed to play against yourself - [X]

## 5. If games had to be cancelled and postponed, they would reside in a file called round-x-a.csv, where the a represents an incremental additional number.

## 6. For the initial rounds, only a league table is shown. After the split, two tables of the upper and lower fraction must be presented separately

## 7. Any custom rules you deem necessary, which are then explained
